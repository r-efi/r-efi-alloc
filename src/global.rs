//! Global Allocator Bridge
//!
//! The stabilized interface of the rust compiler and standard-library to the global allocator is
//! provided by the `core::alloc::GlobalAlloc` trait and the `global_allocator` attribute. Only
//! one crate in every dependency graph can use the `global_allocator` attribute to mark one
//! static variable as the global allocator. The type of it must implement `GlobalAlloc`. Note
//! that this attribute can only be used in the crate-root, not in sub-modules.
//!
//! UEFI is, however, not a natural fit for the global-allocator trait. On UEFI systems, access to
//! all system APIs is done through the system table, which is passed as argument to the
//! application entry-point. Therefore, it is up to the implementor of the entry-point to set up
//! the global state inherent to rust's global allocator.
